## IDA glossary

### **Project description**

The objective is to provide definitions of common terms used by the Initial Data Analysis topics group. Every effort will be made to use existing opne access definitions.

Authors: All TG3 members

Project status: **NEW**

### **Project outcomes:**

Glossary of 10-15 terms with definitions, e.g IDA, EDA, data cleaningm data screening, data quality, 


## Incorporating IDA in courses on statistics

### **Project description**

The objective is to provide an engaging application from itial data analysis to regression models using characters from the Pokémon franchise to address the research question aimed at evaluating the association between Pokémon species weight and other characteristics.

This example provides flexibility for instructors (courses, workshops, seminars, modules) to integrate into their teaching materials or assignments.  Depending on the type of classes, the instructor can emphasize different aspects, for example data descriptions, learning which explorations are meaningful and how to interpret the results, univariable or multivariable regression modeling strategies, learning coding in R, or rigor and reproducibility in planning and executing studies. 

Lead: Lara Lusa

Project status: **ACTIVE**

### **Project outcomes:**

1.\ Manuscript for a journal with a "Teaching corner"

2.\ Curated Pokemon data set for open access

3.\ R code for initial data analysis and for regression models

4.\ Statistical analysis plan for this example

5.\ Diskussion questions or tasks for the students




## IDA for regression models

### **Project description**

The objective is to provide examples on conducting initial data analysis (IDA) in a reproducible manner in the context of intended regression analyses.

### **Supplementary material**

The Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) consists of data on health and socioeconomic variables of non-institutionalized individuals aged 50 and older across several European countries. The data sets includes about 140 000 men and women, ages 50 or older, collected in years 2004 to 2018. The questionnaires include questions on demographics, health (physical, and mental health, cognitive function, grip strength and behavioral risks), and socio-economic status. <https://share-eric.eu>

## Systematic review of IDA reporting

### **Project description**

Our aim was to describe the practice of reporting of initial data analyses in observational studies in five highly ranked medical journals with focus on data cleaning, screening, and reporting of findings which led to a potential change in the analysis plan.

Authors: Marianne Huebner, Werner Vach, Saskia le Cessie, Carsten Oliver Schmidt, Lara Lusa

Project status: **CLOSED, paper published**

### **Project outcomes**

1\. Summary of current IDA reporting by location in papers with examples.

2\. Recommendations for reporting practice of IDA in papers

3\. Manuscript:

Hidden analyses: a review of reporting practice and recommendations for more transparent reporting of initial data analyses
