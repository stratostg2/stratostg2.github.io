### Abstract 

Statistical inference is characterized by a rich epistemological diversity, underpinned by both historical and contemporary debates. The frequentist approach, never having been a closed theory, was characterized by conflicts within statistical methodologies. Similarly, significant differences and even conflicts have existed both within and between frequentist and Bayesian schools.
Despite these tensions, efforts have been made to combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian approaches in a pragmatic manner, rather than adhering dogmatically to one paradigm. Our session aims to explore the extent to which modelling approaches are inherently frequentist or Bayesian, and whether these distinctions lead to divergent results. We will compare Bayesian and frequentist model building in four case studies: predicting bacteremia, estimating the proportion of body fat, describing the orbits of exoplanets, investigating the sense of school-belonging in Austrian pupils. For each case study, a research question suited to a multivariable regression model was defined. Two analysis plans were developed per study by different individuals: one Bayesian and one frequentist. Data is currently being analyzed in parallel, and results will be presented in the session. We will thoroughly discuss each step, examining the nuances of each approach to enhance understanding of the methodological and practical implications of statistical inference paradigms in complex, real-world problems.
