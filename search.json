It can include acquiring data, enriching, changing the format and shape of the data, combining, subsetting and sampling data, and cleaning data. Some common steps involved with Data Wrangling are: \n\nDiscovering and gathering the data needed\nMerging data from different sources, if necessary \nFixing flaws in the data entries \nExtracting the necessary data and put it in the proper structure \nStoring it in the proper format for further use\n\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink\n\n\nData cleaning\nData cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting data that are inaccurate, missing, or incomplete. Data cleaning tasks can include removing duplicate records, investigating extreme values (e.g., outliers), converting dates from one format to another, removing unwanted text, splitting multiple data points in a cell into separate cells, or coding missing or NA values.\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink\n\n\nData screening\nData screening consists of reviewing and documenting the properties and quality of the data that may affect future analysis and interpretation.\nSource: Huebner M, le Cessie S, Schmidt CO, Vach W.

Structuring can be based on levels of measurement (centers), on calendar time of recruitment, on demographic variables such as sex or age, or on variables of central importance to the research questions. Structural variables may or may not be included as predictors in the statistical models.\nSource: [Heinze et al https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-024-02294-3]",

An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions.\n\n\nResults\nWe present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.",

Steyerberg, Georg Heinze, Geraldine Rauch , for topic group 2 of the STRATOS initiative\nLink\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the last decades, statistical methodology has developed rapidly, in particular in the field of regression modeling. Multivariable regression models are applied in almost all medical research projects. Therefore, the potential impact of statistical misconceptions within this field can be enormous Indeed, the current theoretical statistical knowledge is not always adequately transferred to the current practice in medical statistics. Some medical journals have identified this problem and published isolated statistical articles and even whole series thereof. In this systematic review, we aim to assess the current level of education on regression modeling that is provided to medical researchers via series of statistical articles published in medical journals. The present manuscript is a protocol for a systematic review that aims to assess which aspects of regression modeling are covered by statistical series published in medical journals that intend to train and guide applied medical researchers with limited statistical knowledge. Statistical paper series cannot easily be summarized and identified by common keywords in an electronic search engine like Scopus. We therefore identified series by a systematic request to statistical experts who are part or related to the STRATOS Initiative (STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies). Within each identified article, two raters will independently check the content of the articles with respect to a predefined list of key aspects related to regression modeling. The content analysis of the topic-relevant articles will be performed using a predefined report form to assess the content as objectively as possible. Any disputes will be resolved by a third reviewer. Summary analyses will identify potential methodological gaps and misconceptions that may have an important impact on the quality of analyses in medical research. This review will thus provide a basis for future guidance papers and tutorials in the field of regression modeling which will enable medical researchers 1) to interpret publications in a correct way, 2) to perform basic statistical analyses in a correct way and 3) to identify situations when the help of a statistical expert is required.",
