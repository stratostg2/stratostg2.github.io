Regression without regrets –initial data analysis is a prerequisite for multivariable regression. BMC Med Res Methodol 24, 178. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-024-02294-3\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAbstract\nStatistical regression models are used for predicting outcomes based on the values of some predictor variables or for describing the association of an outcome with predictors. With a data set at hand, a regression model can be easily fit with standard software packages. This bears the risk that data analysts may rush to perform sophisticated analyses without sufficient knowledge of basic properties, associations in and errors of their data, leading to wrong interpretation and presentation of the modeling results that lacks clarity. Ignorance about special features of the data such as redundancies or particular distributions may even invalidate the chosen analysis strategy. Initial data analysis (IDA) is prerequisite to regression analyses as it provides knowledge about the data needed to confirm the appropriateness of or to refine a chosen model building strategy, to interpret the modeling results correctly, and to guide the presentation of modeling results. In order to facilitate reproducibility, IDA needs to be preplanned, an IDA plan should be included in the general statistical analysis plan of a research project, and results should be well documented. Biased statistical inference of the final regression model can be minimized if IDA abstains from evaluating associations of outcome and predictors, a key principle of IDA. We give advice on which aspects to consider in an IDA plan for data screening in the context of regression modeling to supplement the statistical analysis plan. We illustrate this IDA plan for data screening in an example of a typical diagnostic modeling project and give recommendations for data visualizations.",

Indeed, the rapidly developing statistical methodology and its recent advances in regression modeling do not seem to be adequately reflected in many medical publications. This problem of knowledge transfer from statistical research to application was identified by some medical journals, which have published series of statistical tutorials and (shorter) papers mainly addressing medical researchers. The aim of this review was to assess the current level of knowledge with regard to regression modeling contained in such statistical papers. We searched for target series by a request to international statistical experts. We identified 23 series including 57 topic-relevant articles. Within each article, two independent raters analyzed the content by investigating 44 predefined aspects on regression modeling. We assessed to what extent the aspects were explained and if examples, software advices, and recommendations for or against specific methods were given. Most series (21/23) included at least one article on multivariable regression. Logistic regression was the most frequently described regression type (19/23), followed by linear regression (18/23), Cox regression and survival models (12/23) and Poisson regression (3/23). Most general aspects on regression modeling, e.g. model assumptions, reporting and interpretation of regression results, were covered. We did not find many misconceptions or misleading recommendations, but we identified relevant gaps, in particular with respect to addressing nonlinear effects of continuous predictors, model specification and variable selection. Specific recommendations on software were rarely given. Statistical guidance should be developed for nonlinear effects, model specification and variable selection to better support medical researchers who perform or interpret regression analyses.",

PLoS ONE 15, e0241427. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241427\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the last decades, statistical methodology has developed rapidly, in particular in the field of regression modeling. Multivariable regression models are applied in almost all medical research projects. Therefore, the potential impact of statistical misconceptions within this field can be enormous Indeed, the current theoretical statistical knowledge is not always adequately transferred to the current practice in medical statistics. Some medical journals have identified this problem and published isolated statistical articles and even whole series thereof. In this systematic review, we aim to assess the current level of education on regression modeling that is provided to medical researchers via series of statistical articles published in medical journals. The present manuscript is a protocol for a systematic review that aims to assess which aspects of regression modeling are covered by statistical series published in medical journals that intend to train and guide applied medical researchers with limited statistical knowledge. Statistical paper series cannot easily be summarized and identified by common keywords in an electronic search engine like Scopus. We therefore identified series by a systematic request to statistical experts who are part or related to the STRATOS Initiative (STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies). Within each identified article, two raters will independently check the content of the articles with respect to a predefined list of key aspects related to regression modeling. The content analysis of the topic-relevant articles will be performed using a predefined report form to assess the content as objectively as possible. Any disputes will be resolved by a third reviewer. Summary analyses will identify potential methodological gaps and misconceptions that may have an important impact on the quality of analyses in medical research. This review will thus provide a basis for future guidance papers and tutorials in the field of regression modeling which will enable medical researchers 1) to interpret publications in a correct way, 2) to perform basic statistical analyses in a correct way and 3) to identify situations when the help of a statistical expert is required.",

Diagn Progn Res 4, 3, s41512-020-00074–3. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41512-020-00074-3\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nBackground\nHow to select variables and identify functional forms for continuous variables is a key concern when creating a multivariable model. Ad hoc ‘traditional’ approaches to variable selection have been in use for at least 50 years. Similarly, methods for determining functional forms for continuous variables were first suggested many years ago. More recently, many alternative approaches to address these two challenges have been proposed, but knowledge of their properties and meaningful comparisons between them are scarce. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, many outstanding issues in multivariable modelling remain. Our main aims are to identify and illustrate such gaps in the literature and present them at a moderate technical level to the wide community of practitioners, researchers and students of statistics.\n\n\nMethods\nWe briefly discuss general issues in building descriptive regression models, strategies for variable selection, different ways of choosing functional forms for continuous variables and methods for combining the selection of variables and functions. We discuss two examples, taken from the medical literature, to illustrate problems in the practice of modelling.\n\n\nResults\nOur overview revealed that there is not yet enough evidence on which to base recommendations for the selection of variables and functional forms in multivariable analysis. Such evidence may come from comparisons between alternative methods. In particular, we highlight seven important topics that require further investigation and make suggestions for the direction of further research.\n\n\nConclusions\nSelection of variables and of functional forms are important topics in multivariable analysis. To define a state of the art and to provide evidence-supported guidance to researchers who have only a basic level of statistical knowledge, further comparative research is required.",

An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions.\n\n\nResults\nWe present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.",

It accounts for the relationships between multiple variables and identifies which factors are most strongly associated with the outcome of interest. This method is commonly used in regression analysis and can help to improve the accuracy of predictions.\n\n\nFunctional form of continuous covariates\nThe functional form of continuous covariates in statistics refers to the mathematical relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. This can be linear, nonlinear, or a combination of both. The choice of functional form can have a significant impact on the results of statistical analysis and should be carefully considered when selecting a model.\n\n\nSpline function\nA spline function is a type of mathematical function used in statistics and numerical analysis to approximate complex curves or surfaces. It consists of multiple polynomial segments that join smoothly at specific points called knots. Spline functions are flexible and can be used to fit data or smooth curves.\n\n\nR (software)\nR is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

It can be used to model and predict outcomes based on input variables, and to identify which variables have the strongest impact on the outcome of interest.\n\n\nRegression, Linear\nLinear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which can be of any type. A linear function of the independent variables is used to model the expected value of the dependent variable. The task of estimating the model means to estimate the unknown coefficients of the independent variables. A constant (intercept) term is added to calibrate the predicted values of the dependent variable to have average zero errors (differences between predicted and observed values of the dependent variable, also called residuals). Mostly, but not necessarily, the coefficients are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors. Linear regression is commonly used for prediction and inference and is a fundamental tool in statistical analysis.\n\n\nRegression, Logistic\nLogistic regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which can be of any type. Unlike linear regression, the outcome variable in logistic regression is not continuous, but rather represents a binary outcome (e.g., success or failure). A linear function of the independent variables is used to model the log odds of one of the levels of the dependent variable. The task of estimating the model means to estimate the unknown coefficients of the independent variables. A constant (intercept) term is added to calibrate the predicted values of the dependent variable to have average zero errors. The coefficients are estimated by the maximum likelihood principle, which maximizes the probability of observing the given data given the model. Logistic regression is commonly used in classification problems, such as predicting whether a patient has a disease based on their symptoms.\n\n\nRegression, Cox\nCox regression, also known as proportional hazards regression, is a statistical method used to model the relationship between the time to an event and one or more independent variables, which can be of any type. The outcome variable is a time-to-event variable that can be censored in some observations (meaning the event of interest has not yet occurred). A linear function of the independent variables is used to model the log relative hazard of an event. The model assumes that the ratio of hazards between any two groups of individuals is constant over time (the proportional hazards assumption), but this assumption can be relaxed by specifying time-dependent coefficients. The coefficients are estimated by maximizing a partial likelihood, which accounts for the censoring of the data. Cox regression is commonly used in survival analysis and is a fundamental tool in medical research and epidemiology.\n\n\nRegression, Poisson\nPoisson regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a count-type dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which can be of any type. A linear function of the independent variables is used to model the log of the expected count of the dependent variable. The model assumes that the expected count of the dependent variable is proportional to the value of the independent variables and that the counts are independent and identically distributed Poisson random variables. The coefficients of the model represent the change in the log expected count of the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. The coefficients are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the model. Poisson regression is commonly used in fields such as epidemiology and finance to model count data.\n\n\nMultivariable\nIn statistical modeling, “multivariable” typically refers to models that include more than one independent variable (also known as predictor or explanatory variables) to predict a dependent variable. In contrast, “multivariate” refers to models that analyze multiple dependent variables at the same time, while “univariable” or “univariate” refers to models that only analyze one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.\n\n\nMultivariate\nIn statistical modeling, “multivariate” typically refers to models that analyze multiple dependent variables at the same time. This is in contrast to “multivariable,” which refers to models that include more than one independent variable, and “univariate” or “univariable,” which refers to models that only analyze one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.\n\n\nRegression modeling\nSee Regression",

    "text": "Keywords used in Sauerbrei 2020\n\nDescriptive modeling\nDescriptive modeling refers to a type of statistical modeling used to summarize a dataset and identify patterns, relationships, and trends. The purpose of descriptive models is to capture the main associations between a dependent variable and the independent variables in the data set, typically using measures such as means, medians, and standard deviations of target variables conditional on the values of other variables and associational quantities such as regression coefficients or nonlinear (smoothing) response functions. Descriptive models are useful for gaining insight into the underlying structure of the data, but are not mainly intended for predictions of future outcomes or for causal conclusions.\n\n\nMethods for variable selection\nVariable selection is the process of identifying the most relevant independent variables for a given dependent variable in a statistical model. One commonly used method is stepwise regression, which involves sequentially adding or removing variables based on their statistical significance. Another method is regularization, which shrinks the coefficients of less important variables towards zero and can be implemented through techniques such as Lasso or the Elastic Net. Information criteria, such as AIC or BIC, can also be used to compare different models and select the best subset of variables. Finally, some machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and random forests, automatically perform variable selection by choosing the most informative variables for predicting the outcome.\n\n\nSpline procedures\nSee Spline function\n\n\nFractional polynomials\nFractional polynomials are a method for modeling nonlinear relationships between a continuous independent variable and a dependent variable in regression analysis. They involve transforming the independent variable by raising it to a power that is a fraction rather than a whole number, allowing for more flexible modeling of nonlinear relationships. Specifically, fractional polynomials use a series of power transformations (e.g., x^-2, x^-1, x^0.5, x^1, x^2) to estimate the functional form of the relationship between the variables. The best fitting model is selected by comparing the likelihoods of different fractional polynomial models, typically using the Akaike Information Criterion or the Bayesian Information Criterion. Fractional polynomials are useful for modeling complex nonlinear relationships between variables in a data-driven way.*\n\n\nCategorisation\nCategorization, in the context of statistical modeling, is the process of grouping continuous independent variables into discrete categories based on a pre-specified set of cut-off points or thresholds. This is done in order to simplify the modeling process and to allow for the use of categorical variables in the model. Categorization can be used for a variety of reasons, including to reduce the effect of outliers or to capture nonlinear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. However, categorization can also lead to loss of information and can make the model less flexible. As such, the decision to categorize continuous variables should be based on careful consideration of the research question, the data, and the assumptions of the model.\n\n\nBias\nIn statistical modeling, bias refers to the systematic error or deviation of a model’s predicted values from the true values. Bias can arise for a variety of reasons, such as using an incorrect functional form for the model, selecting the wrong variables, or omitting important variables from the model. Bias can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the true relationship between the variables, and can result in inaccurate or misleading predictions. It is important to minimize bias in statistical modeling in order to obtain valid and reliable results. This can be achieved by using appropriate modeling techniques, careful variable selection, and by checking the assumptions of the model. Bias can also be reduced by using larger sample sizes, collecting better quality data, and by using appropriate statistical methods to correct for bias if it is detected.\n\n\nShrinkage\nIn statistical modeling, shrinkage refers to the process of reducing the variability of model coefficients by constraining them towards a prior expectation or estimate. This is often done to avoid overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns or relationships. Shrinkage can be achieved through various techniques, such as ridge regression, lasso regression, and Bayesian modeling. These methods penalize large coefficients and encourage them to take on smaller values, thereby reducing the variance of the estimates. Shrinkage can improve the accuracy and generalizability of the model by reducing the effects of noise and improving the model’s ability to make predictions on new data.\n\n\nEmpirical evidence\nIn the context of the evaluation of statistical methods, empirical evidence refers to the results of experiments or analyses that provide insight into the performance of a given statistical method. Empirical evidence is based on the observed behavior of a method when applied to real-world data, and is used to determine whether the method is suitable for a particular task or problem.\nEmpirical evidence can be obtained through various means, such as simulation studies, cross-validation, or experiments using real-world data. These studies are designed to assess the performance of a statistical method with respect to its accuracy, robustness, speed, and scalability.\nEmpirical evidence is crucial in evaluating statistical methods because it provides a basis for determining their strengths and weaknesses, and for comparing their performance with that of other methods. The quality of the evidence depends on the design of the study, the choice of evaluation metrics, and the representativeness and relevance of the data.",

This allows researchers to assess how well different methods perform across a range of scenarios—such as varying sample sizes, noise levels, or model assumptions—when the “true” data-generating process is known. It’s especially useful for comparing methods in terms of accuracy, bias, variance, and robustness.\n\n\nNeutral comparison study\nA neutral comparison study is a type of research specifically designed to compare statistical methods in an unbiased and objective manner. In such studies, the primary goal is not to promote a new method but to fairly evaluate the relative performance of existing methods using consistent criteria and transparent protocols. Neutrality is maintained by ensuring that the study is not conducted by the developers of the methods being evaluated (or at least includes independent collaborators), and by using standardized, realistic datasets or simulations, along with clear, pre-specified performance metrics. These studies play a key role in evidence-based method selection and promote reproducibility and methodological rigor.",

IDA has the following phases: (1) metadata setup; (2) data cleaning; (3) data screening; (4) initial data reporting; (5) refining and updating the research analysis plan; and (6) documenting and reporting IDA. IDA is aligned with the research aims and the statistical analysis plan and does not include hypothesis generating activities.\nSource: Schmidt CO, Vach W, le Cessie S, Huebner M. STRATOS: Introducing the Initial Data Analysis Topic Group (TG3). Biometric Bulletin 2018; 35 (2): 10-11\n\n\nIDA framework\nA structured, principled approach to preparing and understanding data before formal statistical modeling begins. The IDA framework emphasizes systematic exploration and documentation of key aspects of the data, including data quality, distributions, missing values, outliers, and the plausibility of variable values. It also supports informed decisions about data cleaning, transformations, and the selection of analysis populations. In observational studies, the IDA framework helps ensure that subsequent analyses are based on a well-understood and appropriately prepared dataset, enhancing the credibility and transparency of research findings.\nSource: Huebner M, le Cessie S, Schmidt CO, Vach W.

A contemporary conceptual framework for initial data analysis. Observational Studies 2018; 4: 171-192.\n\n\nReporting\nThe process of transparently and comprehensively documenting how an observational study was designed, conducted, analyzed, and interpreted. Good reporting ensures that all relevant details—such as data sources, inclusion criteria, variable definitions, statistical methods, handling of missing data, and sensitivity analyses—are clearly communicated. This enables readers to assess the validity, reproducibility, and generalizability of the findings. Adherence to established reporting guidelines (e.g., STROBE) is key to promoting clarity, transparency, and trust in observational research.\n\n\nFunctional form\nSee Functional forms of continuous covariates\n\n\nVariable transformation\nThe process of applying mathematical functions to variables before including them in a regression model, with the aim of improving model fit, meeting statistical assumptions (e.g., linearity, normality), or enhancing interpretability. Common transformations include logarithmic, square root, and standardization (e.g., z-scores). In observational studies, variable transformation can help address issues such as skewed distributions, outliers, or non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes. Careful documentation and justification of transformations are essential for transparency and reproducibility.",
