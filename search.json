It can include acquiring data, enriching, changing the format and shape of the data, combining, subsetting and sampling data, and cleaning data. Some common steps involved with Data Wrangling are: \n\nDiscovering and gathering the data needed\nMerging data from different sources, if necessary \nFixing flaws in the data entries \nExtracting the necessary data and put it in the proper structure \nStoring it in the proper format for further use\n\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink\n\n\nData cleaning\nData cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting data that are inaccurate, missing, or incomplete. Data cleaning tasks can include removing duplicate records, investigating extreme values (e.g., outliers), converting dates from one format to another, removing unwanted text, splitting multiple data points in a cell into separate cells, or coding missing or NA values.\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink\n\n\nData screening\nData screening consists of reviewing and documenting the properties and quality of the data that may affect future analysis and interpretation.\nSource: Huebner M, le Cessie S, Schmidt CO, Vach W. A contemporary conceptual framework for initial data analysis. Observational Studies 2018; 4: 171-192.\nLink\n\n\nStructural variables\nStructural variables are variables that help to structure initial data analysis results for a clear organization and essential overview of data properties. Structuring can be based on levels of measurement (centers), on calendar time of recruitment, on demographic variables such as sex or age, or on variables of central importance to the research questions. Structural variables may or may not be included as predictors in the statistical models.\nSource: [Heinze et al https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-024-02294-3]",

This includes what type of data is being collected (e.g. free text, numerical, categorical or group data), the full wording of a question, what values are allowable (e.g. numeric ranges, multiple choice codes), and what those values mean (e.g. 0 = no high blood pressure diagnosis, 1 = borderline high blood pressure, 2 = high blood pressure).

The purpose of data provenance is to tell researchers the origin, changes to, and details supporting the confidence or validity of research data. The concept of provenance guarantees that data creators are transparent about their work and where it came from and provides a chain of information where data can be tracked as researchers use other researchers’ data and adapt it for their own purposes.\nSource: National Library of Medicine\nLink",
